# Summary of Certificate Profile Constraints for the first intermediate CA certificate

Profile: C2PA First Intermediate CA

Core Fields:
  Version: v3
  Serial Number: Positive integer (high entropy recommended) up to 20 octets 
  Signature Algorithm: RSA (PSS or SHA2 variants) or ECDSA (SHA2 variants)
  Issuer Name: Matches Subject Name of Root CA.
  Validity Period: Medium-term (e.g., 5 years typical). Specific dates set at generation.
  Subject Name: Unique name for the First Intermediate CA. Requires C, O, CN attributes.
  Subject Public Key Info:
    Algorithm: rsaEncryption or id-ecPublicKey
    RSA Key Size: 3072 bits or larger
    ECC Curve: P-384 or P-521

Extensions:
  Subject Key Identifier:
    Presence: MUST
    Critical: FALSE
    Value: Hash of public key (RFC 5280 Method 1 - SHA-1)
  Authority Key Identifier:
    Presence: MUST
    Critical: FALSE
    Value: Must contain keyIdentifier matching Subject Key Identifier (using RFC 5280 Method 1 - SHA-1). Issuer/Serial optional.
  Key Usage:
    Presence: MUST
    Critical: TRUE
    Bits: keyCertSign, cRLSign
  Basic Constraints:
    Presence: MUST
    Critical: TRUE
    Value: cA=TRUE, pathLenConstraint=1
  Certificate Policies:
    Presence: MUST
    Critical: FALSE
    Value: Must contain c2pa-certificate-policy OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.62558.1.1). Qualifiers optional.
  Authority Information Access:
    Presence: MUST (if CRL Distribution Points is not present)
    Critical: FALSE
    Value: Sequence of AccessDescription. Must include one with accessMethod=id-ad-ocsp. Should include one with accessMethod=id-ad-caIssuers. accessLocation must be HTTP URI.
  CRL Distribution Points:
    Presence: MUST (if Authority Information Access with id-ad-ocsp is not present)
    Critical: FALSE
    Value: Must contain HTTP URI pointing to CRL location.
